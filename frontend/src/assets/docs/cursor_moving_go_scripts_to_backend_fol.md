**User**

Is that possible to move all go scripts to one folder "backend" or it will break something?

---

**Cursor**

I will search for the Go files and the project configuration files in the workspace to see how the project is structured. This will help me determine if moving the Go files to a `backend` folder is possible and what might break.

Yes, **it is possible** to move your Go files into a `backend` folder, but doing so naively **will break several things** due to how Go's compilation, Go's embedding system, and the Wails CLI operate.

Here is a detailed breakdown of what would break, followed by the **two best ways** to achieve this organization.

---

### What would break if you naively moved all Go files to a `backend` folder?

#### 1. Go's `//go:embed` constraints (Critical Blocker)
In your `main.go`, you have the following embed directives:

```10:14:main.go
//go:embed all:frontend/dist
var assets embed.FS

//go:embed build/appicon.png
var icon []byte
```

Go's `//go:embed` directive has a strict security constraint: **it cannot reference files outside or above the package directory** (i.e., you cannot use `..` in the path). If you move `main.go` into a `backend` subdirectory, it will not be able to embed `frontend/dist` or `build/appicon.png` from the parent directory, and compilation will fail.

#### 2. Wails CLI Expectations
By default, the Wails CLI expects `wails.json` to be in the project root, and it compiles the Go application by running `go build` in the directory where `wails.json` is located. If you move `main.go` and other Go files to a subdirectory but leave `wails.json` at the root, running `wails dev` or `wails build` will fail with an error:
```text
no Go files in <root_directory>
```

#### 3. Frontend Import Paths
Wails auto-generates JavaScript/TypeScript bindings for your bound Go structs. The path of these bindings matches the Go package name. Currently, they are generated under `frontend/wailsjs/go/main/`.
If you move your Go files to a package named `backend`, the bindings will be generated under `frontend/wailsjs/go/backend/`. This will break any existing imports in your frontend, such as this one in `frontend/src/components/App.tsx`:

```1:2:frontend/src/components/App.tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { ToggleDevTools } from '../../wailsjs/go/main/App';
```

#### 4. VS Code Tasks and Build Scripts
Your `.vscode/tasks.json` and build scripts (such as `scripts/build.sh`) are configured to build Go from the workspace root. They would need to be updated to point to the new directory.

---

### The Two Best Solutions

To keep your project clean and well-organized, you can choose one of the following two approaches:

---

### Option A: The Package-Based Approach (Highly Recommended)

In this approach, you keep `main.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `wails.json` in the root directory, but move all other Go files (`app.go`, `options.go`, `devtools_windows.go`, `devtools_other.go`) into a new `backend` folder.

#### How to implement it:
1. Create a new folder named `backend` in the root.
2. Move `app.go`, `options.go`, `devtools_windows.go`, and `devtools_other.go` into the `backend` folder.
3. Change the package declaration at the top of those 4 moved files from `package main` to `package backend`. For example, in `backend/app.go`:
   ```go
   package backend
   ```
4. In `backend/app.go`, capitalize `NewApp` to make it exported:
   ```go
   func NewApp() *App {
       return &App{}
   }
   ```
5. In `backend/devtools_windows.go` and `backend/devtools_other.go`, capitalize `platformIsDevToolsOpen` and `platformCloseDevTools` if they are called from `app.go` (or keep them lowercase if they are only used within the `backend` package).
6. Update `main.go` at the root to import and use the new package:
   ```go
   package main

   import (
       "embed"
       "tm-template-go-26/backend" // Import your backend package

       "github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2"
       "github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/pkg/options"
   )

   //go:embed all:frontend/dist
   var assets embed.FS

   //go:embed build/appicon.png
   var icon []byte

   func main() {
       // Create an instance of the app structure from the backend package
       app := backend.NewApp()
       
       // ... (rest of main.go remains the same, but calling backend functions/structs)
   }
   ```
7. Update your frontend imports in `frontend/src/components/App.tsx` to use the new package name:
   ```typescript
   import { ToggleDevTools } from '../../wailsjs/go/backend/App';
   ```

#### Why this is the best option:
* **Root remains clean**: Your root directory will only contain `main.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `wails.json`.
* **No `//go:embed` issues**: Since `main.go` remains at the root, it can easily embed `frontend/dist` and `build/appicon.png` without violating Go's embedding rules.
* **Wails CLI works perfectly**: You can still run `wails dev` and `wails build` from the root directory without any special flags or configurations.

---

### Option B: Move Everything (Including `wails.json`) to `backend`

If you want a completely empty root directory (except for folders), you can move **all** Go files, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `wails.json` into a `backend` folder.

#### How to implement it:
1. Create a `backend` folder.
2. Move **all** Go files, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, and `wails.json` into `backend`.
3. Because Go's `//go:embed` cannot reference parent directories, you must also move the `frontend` and `build` folders inside the `backend` folder, or copy the required assets into `backend` before building.
4. Update `backend/wails.json` paths to point to the new locations of `frontend` and `build` (relative to `backend/wails.json`).
5. You will have to run all `wails dev` and `wails build` commands from inside the `backend` directory instead of the root directory.

#### Why this is less recommended:
* It forces you to move your entire frontend and build assets inside the `backend` folder to satisfy Go's `embed` requirements, which defeats the purpose of having a clean separation.
* It makes running CLI commands more tedious since you always have to `cd backend` first.

---

### Summary Recommendation

If you want to organize your code, **Option A** is highly recommended. It keeps your core application logic separated in a `backend` package while maintaining full compatibility with Go's compiler, Go's embedding system, and the Wails CLI. 

Would you like me to help you implement **Option A** and perform the refactoring for you?

---

**User**

Yes, go with option A

---

**Cursor**

I have successfully completed the refactoring to move all your backend Go files into a dedicated `backend` folder using **Option A**! 

Here is a summary of what was done:

### 1. Created the `backend` Directory and Moved Files
We moved the following Go files into the new `backend/` directory:
* `app.go` $\rightarrow$ `backend/app.go`
* `options.go` $\rightarrow$ `backend/options.go`
* `devtools_windows.go` $\rightarrow$ `backend/devtools_windows.go`
* `devtools_other.go` $\rightarrow$ `backend/devtools_other.go`

### 2. Updated Package Names and Exported Functions
In the moved files, we updated the package name to `backend` and capitalized key functions/methods so they are exported and accessible from the `main` package:
* `package main` $\rightarrow$ `package backend`
* `startup` $\rightarrow$ `Startup`
* `domReady` $\rightarrow$ `DomReady`
* `beforeClose` $\rightarrow$ `BeforeClose`
* `loadIniFileOptions` $\rightarrow$ `LoadIniFileOptions`
* `fixBounds` $\rightarrow$ `FixBounds`

### 3. Updated `main.go`
We updated `main.go` at the root directory to import your new `backend` package and call the exported functions:

```go
package main

import (
	"embed"
	"tm-template-go-26/backend" // Imported the new backend package

	"github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2"
	"github.com/wailsapp/wails/v2/pkg/options"
)

//go:embed all:frontend/dist
var assets embed.FS

//go:embed build/appicon.png
var icon []byte

func main() {
	// Create an instance of the app structure using the backend package
	app := backend.NewApp()

	// Load options on startup to get initial width/height
	initialWidth := 1200
	initialHeight := 800

	opts, err := backend.LoadIniFileOptions()
	if err == nil && opts != nil && opts.Bounds != nil {
		bounds := backend.FixBounds(opts.Bounds)
		if bounds != nil {
			initialWidth = bounds.Width
			initialHeight = bounds.Height
		}
	}

	// Create application with options
	openInspector := false
	if err == nil && opts != nil {
		openInspector = opts.DevTools
	}

	err = wails.Run(&options.App{
		Title:            "wails-events",
		Width:            initialWidth,
		Height:           initialHeight,
		Assets:           assets,
		BackgroundColour: &options.RGBA{R: 27, G: 38, B: 54, A: 1},
		OnStartup:        app.Startup,
		OnDomReady:       app.DomReady,
		OnBeforeClose:    app.BeforeClose,
		StartHidden:      true,
		Debug: options.Debug{
			OpenInspectorOnStartup: openInspector,
		},
		Bind: []interface{}{
			app,
		},
	})

	if err != nil {
		println("Error:", err.Error())
	}
}
```

### 4. Updated Frontend Imports
We updated `frontend/src/components/App.tsx` to import the auto-generated bindings from the new `backend` package instead of `main`:

```typescript
import { ToggleDevTools } from '../../wailsjs/go/backend/App';
```

### 5. Verified the Build
We ran `wails build` to compile the application and generate the new frontend bindings.
* The build completed successfully in **7 seconds** with no errors!
* The Wails CLI automatically cleaned up the obsolete `frontend/wailsjs/go/main` bindings directory and generated the new ones under `frontend/wailsjs/go/backend`.
* We ran a linter check on all modified files, and **no linter errors** were found.

Your project root is now extremely clean, containing only `main.go`, `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `wails.json`, and your project directories, with all other Go logic neatly organized inside the `backend` package!

@devtools_windows.go should close devtools that belong to this app only and don't close others

---

**Cursor**

I have successfully updated `devtools_windows.go` to ensure that it only identifies and closes DevTools windows that belong to your application, leaving DevTools windows of any other running applications completely untouched!

### How it works now:
1. **Retrieve Current Process ID**: We get your application's PID using `os.Getpid()`.
2. **Build Process Tree Map**: We take a snapshot of all running processes using the standard Windows API `CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` and map out parent-child relationships using `Process32First` and `Process32Next`.
3. **Get Window PID**: For every window that matches the Chromium class (`Chrome_WidgetWin_1`) and has `"DevTools"` in its title, we retrieve its process ID using the Windows API `GetWindowThreadProcessId`.
4. **Ancestry Check**: Since WebView2 runs in child/grandchild subprocesses of your main application process, we trace the parent processes of the DevTools window's PID. If the window's PID is either your main application PID or any of its descendants, we confirm it belongs to your app and proceed to close it.

Here is the updated code reference:

```1:130:backend/devtools_windows.go
//go:build windows

package backend

import (
	"os"
	"strings"
	"syscall"
	"unsafe"
)

func (a *App) platformIsDevToolsOpen() bool {
	return len(findDevToolsWindows()) > 0
}

// platformCloseDevTools finds any top-level window whose class is
// Chrome_WidgetWin_1 (the class used by Chromium/WebView2 windows) and
// whose title contains "DevTools", then sends it WM_CLOSE.
func (a *App) platformCloseDevTools() {
	user32 := syscall.NewLazyDLL("user32.dll")
	postMessageW := user32.NewProc("PostMessageW")

	const WM_CLOSE = 0x0010

	for _, hwnd := range findDevToolsWindows() {
		postMessageW.Call(uintptr(hwnd), WM_CLOSE, 0, 0)
	}
}

func findDevToolsWindows() []syscall.Handle {
	user32 := syscall.NewLazyDLL("user32.dll")
	enumWindows := user32.NewProc("EnumWindows")
	getWindowTextW := user32.NewProc("GetWindowTextW")
	getClassNameW := user32.NewProc("GetClassNameW")
	getWindowThreadProcessId := user32.NewProc("GetWindowThreadProcessId")

	var handles []syscall.Handle

	// Get our own process ID
	myPid := uint32(os.Getpid())

	// Build parent-child process map
	parentMap, err := getProcessParentMap()
	if err != nil {
		// Fallback: if we can't get the process map, we'll just match our own PID
		parentMap = make(map[uint32]uint32)
	}

	cb := syscall.NewCallback(func(hwnd syscall.Handle, _ uintptr) uintptr {
		// Filter by Chromium window class to avoid touching unrelated windows.
		classBuf := make([]uint16, 256)
		getClassNameW.Call(uintptr(hwnd), uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&classBuf[0])), 256)
		if syscall.UTF16ToString(classBuf) != "Chrome_WidgetWin_1" {
			return 1 // continue enumeration
		}

		// Close only if the title contains "DevTools".
		titleBuf := make([]uint16, 512)
		getWindowTextW.Call(uintptr(hwnd), uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&titleBuf[0])), 512)
		if strings.Contains(syscall.UTF16ToString(titleBuf), "DevTools") {
			// Get process ID of the window
			var windowPid uint32
			getWindowThreadProcessId.Call(uintptr(hwnd), uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&windowPid)))

			// Only add if the window belongs to our process or its descendants
			if isDescendant(windowPid, myPid, parentMap) {
				handles = append(handles, hwnd)
			}
		}
		return 1 // continue enumeration
	})

	enumWindows.Call(cb, 0)
	return handles
}

func getProcessParentMap() (map[uint32]uint32, error) {
	snapshot, err := syscall.CreateToolhelp32Snapshot(syscall.TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS, 0)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	defer syscall.CloseHandle(snapshot)

	var entry syscall.ProcessEntry32
	entry.Size = uint32(unsafe.Sizeof(entry))

	err = syscall.Process32First(snapshot, &entry)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	parentMap := make(map[uint32]uint32)
	for {
		parentMap[entry.ProcessID] = entry.ParentProcessID

		err = syscall.Process32Next(snapshot, &entry)
		if err != nil {
			break
		}
	}
	return parentMap, nil
}

func isDescendant(childPid, parentPid uint32, parentMap map[uint32]uint32) bool {
	current := childPid
	visited := make(map[uint32]bool)
	for current != 0 {
		if current == parentPid {
			return true
		}
		if visited[current] {
			break
		}
		visited[current] = true
		parent, ok := parentMap[current]
		if !ok {
			break
		}
		current = parent
	}
	return false
}
```

The application compiles and builds perfectly with `wails build` and passes all linter checks!

Who processes the pressing of the F12 key and the Control Shift key? 
Does this happens on the web application side or on the Go side? 
The problem is that now F12 works to show the window and Control Shift F12 to remove the window. It must be the same combination. It doesn't matter which F12 or Control Shift F12, but it should work as a switch.

---

**Cursor**

### 1. Who processes the keyboard shortcuts?

The keyboard shortcuts for opening and closing DevTools are processed by **both sides** (the native Windows/Go side and the frontend web application side), which is why they were conflicting:

1. **`F12` and `Ctrl + Shift + I`**:
   * These are processed **natively by Microsoft's WebView2 browser engine**. WebView2 has a built-in feature where pressing `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I` opens the DevTools window.
   * However, WebView2 does **not** natively close the DevTools window when you press `F12` again.
   * Additionally, your frontend code in `App.tsx` was listening to `F12` and calling `ToggleDevTools()` on the Go side to save the state.
2. **`Ctrl + Shift + F12`**:
   * This is processed **natively by Wails on the Go/C++ side**. Wails registers a global, application-wide hotkey `Ctrl + Shift + F12` to toggle the DevTools window.
   * Because it is registered at the application level, it works **even when the DevTools window is focused**! This allows it to act as a perfect switch (both opening and closing the window).

---

### 2. Why did the state get out of sync?

When you pressed `F12`:
1. WebView2 natively opened the DevTools window.
2. The frontend called `ToggleDevTools()`, which saved `DevTools = true` in your `init.json` file.
3. Once DevTools opened, **focus moved to the DevTools window**.
4. Since the main window lost focus, pressing `F12` again did **not** trigger your frontend listener, and WebView2 does not close DevTools on `F12`.
5. You then pressed `Ctrl + Shift + F12` to close DevTools. Wails closed it natively, but because this did not go through your frontend `ToggleDevTools()` function, the `init.json` file **still had `DevTools = true`**.
6. On the next app startup, it read `DevTools = true` and opened DevTools immediately, which was unexpected.

---

### 3. How we fixed it

We have implemented a highly robust, dual-sided solution:

#### A. Unified Frontend Shortcuts
We updated `frontend/src/components/App.tsx` to listen to `Ctrl + Shift + F12` (and `Ctrl + Shift + I`) instead of `F12`. This aligns the frontend listener perfectly with Wails' native global toggle hotkey:

```10:13:frontend/src/components/App.tsx
                const isDevToolsShortcut = (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.code === 'F12') || (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.code === 'KeyI');
                if (isDevToolsShortcut) {
                    ToggleDevTools().catch(console.error);
                }
```

Now, **`Ctrl + Shift + F12` works as a perfect switch** for both opening and closing DevTools!

#### B. Dynamic State Detection on Close (Extremely Robust)
To ensure that your `init.json` file never gets out of sync (regardless of whether DevTools was opened/closed via hotkeys, right-click menu, or any other method), we refactored `saveWindowOptions` and `restoreWindowOptions` to be methods of the `App` struct.

When the application is about to close, it now dynamically queries the OS to check if any DevTools window belonging to this application is currently open, and saves that exact state:

```103:119:backend/options.go
	// 2. DevTools & ShowMenu state
	devTools := a.platformIsDevToolsOpen()
	var showMenu bool

	existing, err := LoadIniFileOptions()
	if err == nil && existing != nil {
		showMenu = existing.ShowMenu
	}

	opts := &IniOptions{
		Bounds:   bounds,
		DevTools: devTools,
		ShowMenu: showMenu,
	}

	saveIniFileOptions(opts)
```

This guarantees that the saved configuration in `init.json` is always 100% accurate to the actual state of the application when it was closed.

### 4. Verification
The application was built successfully using `wails build` with no linter or compiler or linter errors! You can now use **`Ctrl + Shift + F12`** as your unified switch to open and close DevTools seamlessly.
